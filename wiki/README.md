# **Welcome to Hitungan**

Hitungan a.k.a **ProCalc** is a basic calculator for handling big numbers such as multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. The application also has other features namely modulus, square root, nth-root, nth-power, factorial, and prime number finder. Furthermore, the result can be copied, pasted, saved to an RTF file on your working document folder.

Hitungan depends on the following requirements:

- .NET Framework 4.0
- Visual C++ 2010 Runtime

**WebCalc** is a web version of Hitungan and it has only basic operations and needs **Silverlight** to be installed on the client side.

Sample of 1 million big numbers multiplication

In order to execute the application, .NET Frameworks 4.0 and Visual C++ 2010 Runtime must be previously installed. Once they are already deployed, copy the application to a folder and send a shortcut to the Windows Desktop.

Usage

To calculate numbers, enter the first number, then an operator (+, or -, or *, or /, or ), then the second number, and finally enter the "=". The result will be displayed adjacent to the ProCalc buttons including time of execution. If the numbers are more than two, enter an operator after each number after the second number, and enter the "=" to see the result.

To clear the display, click the C button.

For finding a square root of a number, enter the input number than click the square root button.
For finding an n-th root of a number, enter the first number, then click the n-th root button, then enter the n-th root number, and finally click the n-th root button again to see the result.
For finding an n-th power of a number, enter the first number, then click the n-th power button, then enter the n-th power number, and finally click the n-th power button again to see the result.
For finding a factorial of a number, enter a number, then click the factorial button.
For finding a prime number, enter an iteration number, then click the Prime Number button.

The result can be copied and pasted through the Edit menu, and can be saved through the File menu. 

For demo purpose, the application provides calculation between two 1-million numbers through the Big Numbers Demo menu.

Notes

The factorial calculation is limited to 1500, meanwhile entering a big iteration number for finding a prime number can consume a huge amount of time of execution.
